Food Delivery Time Prediction Using Machine Learning

Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict food delivery times based on various factors such as weather, traffic conditions, restaurant preparation time, and distance. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can provide more accurate delivery time estimates to improve customer satisfaction and optimize delivery operations.

Problem Statement


Food delivery services often struggle with estimating accurate delivery times due to unpredictable factors like weather, road traffic, and restaurant workload. Inaccurate delivery estimates can lead to customer dissatisfaction and inefficient resource allocation. This project seeks to build a machine learning model that predicts delivery times using historical data and real-time variables.


Features Considered

Order Features: Order time, preparation time, restaurant location.

Delivery Features: Distance, delivery vehicle type (bike, car, scooter).

Environmental Factors: Weather conditions, traffic congestion.


Business Impact

✅ Improved customer experience through accurate estimated delivery times.

✅ Efficient delivery route planning and resource management.

✅ Cost reduction by minimizing idle time and optimizing fuel usage.

✅ Competitive advantage by providing reliable delivery time estimates.
